Probability and Statistics Analysis
===========================================

Description:
-------------
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of resources for **Probability** and **Statistics**. The content includes fundamental concepts, theory, and practical applications using Python. The focus is on helping learners build a strong understanding of both fields, with examples, visualizations, and code to demonstrate each concept.

**Probability** and **Statistics** are fundamental areas in data science, and this repository covers key topics such as probability distributions, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and more.

Topics Covered:
---------------
- **Probability**:
    - Basic Probability Theory
    - Conditional Probability
    - Common Probability Distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson)
    - Random Variables and Expected Value
    - Monte Carlo Simulations

- **Statistics**:
    - Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Variance)
    - Inferential Statistics (Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing)
    - Statistical Tests (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-Square)
    - Correlation and Regression Analysis
    - Data Visualizations (Histograms, Box Plots, Scatter Plots)

Learning Objectives:
--------------------
- Understand key concepts in Probability and Statistics.
- Implement Probability and Statistical models in Python.
- Use real-world datasets to apply these concepts.
- Build an intuition for applying statistical tests and techniques in various domains.
